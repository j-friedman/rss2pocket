rss2pocket.py
=============

This is a really hacky script that adds entries from an rss feed to my Pocket
account. Because some blogs are just hard to look at on my phone, and I like
Pocket more than any of the rss readers I've used so far.

It relies on sendmail or some kind of drop in replacement, like msmtp.
